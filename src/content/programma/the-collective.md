The Collective is a module that requires **international** and / or **interdisciplinary** teamwork: you get the chance to work together with Communication Management, Occupational Therapy, Network Economy, Tourism & Recreation Management, DAE and Industrial Product Design students.

You have already a ton of project work experience but it is a whole different ball game when you team up with people with another background. For the first time more aspects than the mere technical ones deserve your attention: finance, marketing, sales ...
Sometimes these aspects will need you to kill your darling ideas(s) and move forward. Agile working will lead to success.

As a technical expert (IoT Engineer, Next Web Developer, AI Engineer or XR Developer) you need to do research and work out of your comfort zone and seek for help. Luckily a multitude of people are ready to help you if you can explain what you are doing and in what manner you need their help.
You and your team are all but alone in this endeavour: experts and teacher-coaches help you all the way.
